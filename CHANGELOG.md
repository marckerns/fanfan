Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) · [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)

## [1.0.8] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- Automatic fan control could silently stop after the app sat in the background (e.g. lid closed or no foreground window). As an `.accessory` menu-bar app, macOS App Nap froze the monitoring and fan-control `Timer`s, so scheduling never resumed on wake until the user reopened the menu bar. The app now holds a `userInitiatedAllowingIdleSystemSleep` activity token for the lifetime of the process, keeping the timers alive while still letting the system sleep normally (closing the lid still saves power).

## [1.0.7] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- Automatic mode could leave the fan stuck on firmware control after `restoreAutomaticControl()` handed it back (e.g. after screen sleep). `lastAppliedSpeed` stayed pinned at the previous saturated value, so when the next PID cycle saturated to the same ceiling the hysteresis check saw `diff == 0` and skipped the write. Re-engagement now re-seeds `lastAppliedSpeed` from the fan's real RPM, matching `startAutoControl()`'s seeding strategy.

### Performance
- `FanControlViewModel` now publishes `maxTemperature`, `ssdTemperature`, and `batterySensorTemperature` as cached `@Published` properties driven by Combine, so the popover and status-bar icon stop running `allSensors.first(where:)` and `max(cpu, gpu)` on every render pass.
- `FanBladeView` short-circuits the `TimelineView(.animation)` subtree when `visualRps == 0`, so an idle blade no longer redraws each vsync. The per-blade `BladeShape` was also collapsed into a single `FanRotorShape`, halving SwiftUI subview count.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- Tag-triggered GitHub Actions workflow now auto-syncs the Homebrew tap (`hoobnn/tap`) on every `v*` release, so `brew upgrade fanfan` picks up new versions without manual cask edits.

### Changed
- Reverted the Simplified Chinese locale directory back to `zh-Hans.lproj` and restored `knownRegions` to `"zh-Hans"` (undoes the rename from 1.0.4).

## [1.0.5] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- Fan blade rotation no longer stutters at low RPM. The previous fixed 30 fps schedule drifted against the display vsync (60 / 120 Hz), producing visibly uneven angle steps; rotation now runs off `TimelineView(.animation)` while the static accent bloom and inner dot stay outside the timeline subtree, keeping per-frame work bounded.
- `scripts/install.sh` permission and cleanup issues.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Settings now includes an **About** section with the installed version/build and a **Check for Updates** button that queries the GitHub Releases API and offers a one-click download if a newer version is available.

### Changed
- Renamed the Simplified Chinese locale directory from `zh-Hans.lproj` to `zh.lproj` and updated `knownRegions` accordingly.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-05-15

### Performance
- Tiered `SystemMonitor` polling: fast tier (CPU/GPU temp + fan RPM) still runs every tick, while the full sensor scan now runs at most every `max(6 s, interval × 3)`, cutting IOKit traffic on Macs with rich SMC catalogues.
- Cache per-fan `Mn` / `Mx` SMC limits once per fan-count instead of re-reading them every tick; caching only commits once every read succeeds so transient startup / wake-from-sleep failures still self-heal.
- `ControlsCard` now consumes a value-typed `ControlsSnapshot` and conforms to `Equatable`, letting SwiftUI skip body re-evaluation on unrelated `@Published` ticks (e.g. 2 s temperature updates) and cancel pending debounced slider writes on `.onDisappear`.
- Cap the rotating fan blade animation to 30 fps (down from display-refresh rate) and lift the static accent bloom + inner dot out of `TimelineView` so they stop re-evaluating every frame.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-15

### Performance
- Halved menu-bar icon animation CPU cost: lowered frame rate from 30 fps to 15 fps, skips `setImage:` calls when the quantized rotation slot is unchanged, and switched to template image mode so WindowServer handles tinting centrally.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- App now appears in Launchpad (`LSUIElement` set to `NO`); Dock icon is hidden immediately in `applicationWillFinishLaunching` to minimize the brief flash.

### Fixed
- Eliminated ~40% idle main-thread CPU caused by `FanBladeView`'s `TimelineView(.animation)` ticking at display-refresh rate while the popover was closed. The `NSHostingController` is now mounted on popover open and torn down on close.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-15

First public release. Runs on macOS 26+, Apple Silicon and Intel.

### Added
- Real-time CPU/GPU temperature monitoring via IOKit / SMC.
- Three control modes: Manual, Automatic, System.
- Automatic controller with rolling history, ±200 RPM hysteresis, and four presets (Silent / Balanced / Performance / Custom).
- Per-fan independent RPM control on multi-fan machines; graceful no-fan fallback on fanless models.
- Status bar display modes (temperature / power / fan % / icon) and configurable high-temp alert.
- Launch at Login via `ServiceManagement`; English and Simplified Chinese localization.

### Security
- Privileged SMC writes isolated to a minimal C LaunchDaemon (`com.hoobnn.fanfan.smcd`); the app itself runs unprivileged.
- Daemon socket exposes only three commands: `PING`, `SET`, `AUTO`.
- Releases are Developer ID signed and notarized.
